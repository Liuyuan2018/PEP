This folder (Learning) is created to store the raw data used for the
unsupervised word embedding model training process and the feature
vectors of the words from the positive and negative samples generated
by the trained word embedding model

If you use the command python PEP.py -c CellName -t 'ep'(e.g., python
PEP.py -c 'GM12878' -t 'ep'), files named "unlabeled_trainraw_enhancer_GM12878",
"unlabeled_trainraw_promoter_GM12878" and "supervised_GM12878_ep" will
be generated in this folder.
