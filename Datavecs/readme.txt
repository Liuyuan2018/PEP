*******************************************************************************
This folder (Datavecs) is created to store the feature vectors of
enhancer/promoter regions generated by the trained word embedding model.

If you use the command python PEP.py -c CellName -t 'ep'(e.g., python PEP.py
-c 'GM12878' -t 'ep'), files named "datavecs_CellName_ep.npy" will be
generated in this folder, which comprises the feature representation of
enhancer/promoter sequences obtained from the word embbeding models and TF-IDF
dictionaries using weighted pooling.
